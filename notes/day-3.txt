interaction between two nested components:
	a. passing data from parent to child/nested (custom attribute of a component which can receive data from parent)
		declare a property in the nested component with Input() decorator
		use the property from parent component to pass the data to nested component
	b. passing data from nested to its parent
		create an event in the nested component (declare a property in the nested component class and assign the property to an object of EventEmitter<T>)
		fire the event from the nested component (by callin the emit() method) and pass the data trough that event to the parent
		in the parent component design, bind the event of the nested component with the method of parent component class

component life cycle
1. creation:
	a. constructor
	b. changes (event)
	c. init (event)

2. updation
	a. changes
	...........

3. destruction
